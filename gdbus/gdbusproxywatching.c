/**
 * g_bus_watch_proxy:
 * @bus_type: The type of bus to watch a name on (can't be #G_BUS_TYPE_NONE).
 * @name: The name (well-known or unique) to watch.
 * @object_path: The object path of the remote object to watch.
 * @interface_name: The D-Bus interface name for the proxy.
 * @interface_type: The #GType for the kind of proxy to create. This must be a #GDBusProxy derived type.
 * @proxy_flags: Flags from #GDBusProxyFlags to use when constructing the proxy.
 * @proxy_appeared_handler: Handler to invoke when @name is known to exist and the
 * requested proxy is available.
 * @proxy_vanished_handler: Handler to invoke when @name is known to not exist
 * and the previously created proxy is no longer available.
 * @user_data: User data to pass to handlers.
 * @user_data_free_func: Function for freeing @user_data or %NULL.
 *
 * Starts watching a remote object at @object_path owned by @name on
 * the bus specified by @bus_type. When the object is available, a
 * #GDBusProxy (or derived class cf. @interface_type) instance is
 * constructed for the @interface_name D-Bus interface and then
 * @proxy_appeared_handler will be called when the proxy is ready and
 * all properties have been loaded. When @name vanishes,
 * @proxy_vanished_handler is called.
 *
 * This function makes it very simple to write applications that wants
 * to watch a well-known remote object on a well-known name, see <xref
 * linkend="gdbus-watching-proxy"/>. Basically, the application simply
 * starts using the proxy when @proxy_appeared_handler is called and
 * stops using it when @proxy_vanished_handler is called. Callbacks
 * will be invoked in the <link
 * linkend="g-main-context-push-thread-default">thread-default main
 * loop</link> of the thread you are calling this function from.
 *
 * Applications typically use this function to watch the
 * <quote>manager</quote> object of a well-known name. Upon acquiring
 * a proxy for the manager object, applications typically construct
 * additional proxies in response to the result of enumeration methods
 * on the manager object.
 *
 * Many of the comment that applies to g_bus_watch_name() also applies
 * here. For example, you are guaranteed that one of the handlers will
 * be invoked (on the main thread) after calling this function and
 * also that the two handlers alternate. When you are done watching the
 * proxy, just call g_bus_unwatch_proxy().
 *
 * Returns: An identifier (never 0) that can be used with
 * g_bus_unwatch_proxy() to stop watching the remote object.
